# CC-Viewer

Based on Claude Code, a Vibe Coding tool that distills and accumulates real development experience:

## Usage

### Prerequisites

* Make sure nodejs 20.0.0+ is installed; [Download and install](https://nodejs.org)
* Make sure claude code is installed; [Installation guide](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code)

### Install ccv

#### Install via npm

```bash
npm install -g cc-viewer --registry=https://registry.npmjs.org
```

#### Install via Homebrew (recommended for macOS / Linux)

```bash
brew tap weiesky/cc-viewer
brew install cc-viewer
brew upgrade cc-viewer   # use this to upgrade; do NOT use npm install -g to upgrade a brew-installed ccv
```

### How to start

ccv is a drop-in replacement for claude — all arguments are passed through to claude while the Web Viewer is launched alongside it.

```bash
ccv                    # == claude (interactive mode)
```

The command I use most often is:

```
ccv -c --d             # == claude --continue --dangerously-skip-permissions
                       # ccv passes through every Claude Code launch argument — feel free to combine them however you like
```

Once started in programming mode, the web page opens automatically.

cc-viewer also ships as a native desktop app: [download page](https://github.com/weiesky/cc-viewer/releases)

### Logger mode

If you still prefer the native claude tool or the VS Code extension, use this mode.

In this mode, launching `claude` will automatically start a logging process that records request logs to \~/.claude/cc-viewer/*yourproject*/date.jsonl

Enable logger mode:

```bash
ccv -logger
```

When the console cannot print a specific port, the default first port is 127.0.0.1:7008. If multiple instances exist, ports increment sequentially — 7009, 7010, and so on.

Uninstall logger mode:

```bash
ccv --uninstall
```

### Troubleshooting

If you run into start-up issues, here's the ultimate troubleshooting recipe:
Step 1: Open Claude Code in any directory;
Step 2: Give Claude Code the following instruction:

```
I have installed the cc-viewer npm package, but running ccv still doesn't work properly. Check cc-viewer's cli.js and findcc.js and adapt them to the local Claude Code deployment based on the specific environment. Keep the scope of changes confined to findcc.js as much as possible.
```

Letting Claude Code diagnose the problem on its own is more effective than asking anyone or reading any documentation!

Once the instruction is done, `findcc.js` will have been updated. If your project frequently needs local deployment, or your forked code often runs into installation issues, just keep this file — next time you can simply copy it over. At this stage many projects and companies use Claude Code on server-side hosted deployments rather than on Mac, so I split out `findcc.js` to make it easier to keep tracking upstream cc-viewer source updates.

Note: this app conflicts with claude-code-switch and claude-code-router — there is a proxy contention problem, so make sure you turn off claude-code-switch and claude-code-router when using it. cc-viewer provides built-in proxy hot-reload that can replace them.

### Other helper commands

See:

```bash
ccv -h
```

### Silent Mode

By default, `ccv` runs in silent mode when wrapping `claude`, keeping your terminal output clean and consistent with the native experience. All logs are captured in the background and can be viewed at `http://localhost:7008`.

Once configured, just use the `claude` command as usual. Visit `http://localhost:7008` to open the monitoring UI.

## Features

### Programming mode

After launching with ccv you'll see:

<img height="765" width="1500" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ab353a2b-f101-409d-a28c-6a4e41571ea2" />

You can view the code diff directly right after an edit:

While you can open files and code by hand, that's not recommended — that's the old-school way!

### Mobile programming

You can even scan a QR code and code from a mobile device:

<img height="1460" width="3018" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8debf48e-daec-420c-b37a-609f8b81cd20" />

Everything you imagined about mobile coding — plus a plugin mechanism: if you need to customize for your own coding habits, stay tuned for plugin hook updates.

### Password protection

By default, remote (LAN) access requires the `?token=` query that ccv prints at startup. As an alternative that's friendlier to share, scan, or bookmark, you can turn on **password login**:

* Start with `ccv --usePassword` to enable it immediately. A bare flag auto-generates a 6-character password (uppercase letters + digits) and prints it to the console; `ccv --usePassword=<your-password>` sets a specific one. The password is shown in uppercase but matched case-insensitively at login, so it's easy to type on a phone.
* The machine that opens ccv on `127.0.0.1` is the **admin**: it never needs a password and is the only one allowed to view or change it. Open the QR-code popover — directly below the QR you can enable protection, edit/copy the password, or turn it back off.
* Remote devices opening the LAN URL (without a token) are shown a minimal password page; entering the correct password sets an `HttpOnly` cookie and the page refreshes into the app. The existing `?token=` URL keeps working in parallel.
* An **empty password means no protection at all** — it is allowed, but the admin UI shows a clear security warning.
* **Global default + per-project override:** by default one password covers every project. From the QR popover the admin can switch between **This project** and **Global** — set a project-specific password that overrides the global default for that project only, or remove the override to inherit the global setting again. (A disabled project override means "no protection for this project", which is different from removing it.)
* The on/off state and password(s) are persisted alongside your other settings in cc-viewer's `preferences.json` — a global `auth` key plus an optional `authByProject` map (the password is base64-obfuscated, not stored as raw plaintext; file mode `0600`). The login cookie is tied to the per-launch token, so restarting ccv requires remote devices to log in again.

### Model-specific system prompts

The **Edit System Prompt** modal (Preferences → Expert Settings) is tabbed:

* The **Default** tab keeps the classic behavior: it writes `CC_SYSTEM.md` (override) or `CC_APPEND_SYSTEM.md` (append) into the current workspace, injected as `--system-prompt-file` / `--append-system-prompt-file` on the next ccv launch.
* **Model tabs**: click **+ Add model**, type a name such as `opus` or `Gemini3`, and pick a scope — **Global** (`~/.claude/cc-viewer/system_prompt/`, applies to every workspace) or **Workspace** (`<project>/system_prompt/`). Each tab has its own Append/Override switch and Markdown preview.
* Entries are stored as uppercase files: `OPUS_SYSTEM.md` (override) or `OPUS_APPEND_SYSTEM.md` (append). Matching is fuzzy — a case-insensitive substring of the model ID used at the last launch, so `opus` matches `claude-opus-4-8[1m]` regardless of version. A workspace match beats a global one; within a scope the longest name wins; a matched entry fully replaces the Default files for that launch.
* Saving a tab empty deletes the entry. Model switches made mid-session apply at the next relaunch. Set `CCV_DISABLE_AUTO_SYSTEM_PROMPT=1` to disable all automatic injection. You may commit `<project>/system_prompt/` to share prompts with your team, or add it to `.gitignore` to keep them private.

<img width="860" alt="cc-viewer — wire-level capture and packet decomposition" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/weiesky/cc-viewer/main/docs/cc-viewer-proxy.svg" />

* Captures every API request from Claude Code in real time, guaranteeing the raw payload rather than a censored log (this matters a lot!!!)
* Automatically identifies and labels Main Agent and Sub Agent requests (subtypes: Plan, Search, Bash)
* MainAgent requests support Body Diff JSON, showing only the diff against the previous MainAgent request (only changed/added fields) in a collapsed view
* Each request inlines Token usage stats (input/output tokens, cache creation/read, hit rate)
* Compatible with Claude Code Router (CCR) and other proxy scenarios — falls back to matching requests by API path pattern
